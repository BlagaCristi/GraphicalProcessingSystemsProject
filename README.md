## Project description
This project was implemented during the course of Graphical Processing Systems at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca.
The main focus of this project is the development of a photorealistic 3D scene in which different graphics principles and algorithms are deployed. 
There will be different animations deployed throughout the scene, both autonomous and user controlled (such as lighting, shadows, rain etc.). 
The scene will also be explorable by the user with the use of the keyboard and the mouse.
For a comprehensive description of the project, please refer to the **Documentation** file.

## Running the application
The application can be run directly by running the executable located in **OpenGL_4_Application_VS2015/OpenGL_4_Application_VS2015.exe**.
